# extension-hub

## What?

A ==*free*== alternative to Chrome Web extension.

## Why?

I chose to do this because Chrome Web Store needed money to make extensions.

### But couldn't you just use Edge's version of it?

Yeah, but I need it to be accessible to everyone. You probably cannot install
Edge extensions in Chrome.

## Who?

I'm the "Who" who made this!

## NOTICE
I will not make any extensions paid. Don't ask why, it's at the top.
